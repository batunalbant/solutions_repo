# Problem 1

# Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

## Introduction
Understanding and analyzing electrical circuits is a fundamental aspect of electrical engineering and physics. One of the essential tasks in circuit analysis is determining the equivalent resistance between two points. Traditional methods rely on step-by-step application of series and parallel resistor combinations, which can become impractical for large and complex circuits. The need for a more systematic and scalable approach arises in applications such as circuit simulation, network analysis, and embedded system design.

Graph theory provides an alternative and efficient approach by representing the circuit as a weighted graph, where:

**Nodes** correspond to junctions.

**Edges** correspond to resistors with resistance values as weights.

By systematically simplifying this representation using graph algorithms, we can compute the equivalent resistance efficiently. This approach is particularly useful in modern circuit analysis tools, simulation software, and optimization techniques used in electronic circuit design. It also provides an automated way to handle complex networks, making the process faster and less prone to human errors.

## Motivation
Calculating equivalent resistance is a fundamental problem in electrical circuits, essential for understanding and designing efficient systems. Traditional methods involve iteratively applying series and parallel resistor rules, which become cumbersome for complex circuits. Graph theory provides a structured and algorithmic alternative, allowing us to model circuits as weighted graphs where:

**Nodes** represent circuit junctions.

**Edges** represent resistors, weighted by resistance values.

By employing graph reduction techniques, we can systematically simplify even intricate networks, leading to efficient circuit analysis methods used in modern applications like circuit simulation software, optimization problems, and network design. This method also integrates well with software-based solutions, allowing for real-time modifications and enhancements in circuit analysis.

## Theoretical Background

### Graph Representation of Electrical Circuits

An electrical circuit can be represented as a graph:
**Vertices (V):** Represent junctions where resistors connect.

**Edges (E):** Represent resistors, with edge weights corresponding to resistance values.

**Adjacency Matrix or List:** Used to store the graph structure, where each row represents a node and each column represents a connection to another node with a specific resistance value.

### Series and Parallel Resistance in Graphs


**Series Connection:**
   - Resistors in series have the same current flowing through them.

   - The total voltage across them is the sum of the individual voltages:

     $$
     V_{eq} = V_1 + V_2 + ... + V_n
     $$

   - Using Ohmâ€™s Law (\( V = IR \)):

     $$
     I R_{eq} = I R_1 + I R_2 + ... + I R_n
     $$

   - Canceling the common current \( I \):

     $$
     R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n
     $$

   - Graphically, this corresponds to **contracting** a path of connected edges into a single edge, thus reducing the complexity of the graph.


**Parallel Connection:**
   - Resistors in parallel share the same voltage.

   - The total current is the sum of the individual currents:

     $$
     I_{eq} = I_1 + I_2 + ... + I_n
     $$

   - Using Ohmâ€™s Law:

     $$
     \frac{V}{R_{eq}} = \frac{V}{R_1} + \frac{V}{R_2} + ... + \frac{V}{R_n}
     $$

   - Canceling the common voltage \( V \):

     $$
     \frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ... + \frac{1}{R_n}
     $$

   - Graphically, this corresponds to **merging** multiple edges between two nodes into a single edge with a new weight.

   - This merging reduces the computational complexity when analyzing circuits with multiple interconnected resistors.

### Extended Formulas for Complex Cases

For circuits involving mixed configurations of series and parallel resistances, the equivalent resistance must be determined iteratively. If a circuit consists of nested parallel and series resistances, the calculation follows a hierarchical approach:

- Identify the **innermost** parallel or series components.

- Compute their equivalent resistance.

- Replace these components with their equivalent resistance and repeat the process.

- Continue until only one resistance remains.

For example, if a circuit consists of three resistors \( R_1, R_2, R_3 \) arranged in a mixed configuration:

- \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) in parallel:

  $$
  \frac{1}{R_{12}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}
  $$

- Then, \( R_{12} \) is in series with \( R_3 \):

  $$
  R_{eq} = R_{12} + R_3
  $$

- If an additional resistor \( R_4 \) is in parallel with \( R_{eq} \), we apply the parallel formula again:

  $$
  \frac{1}{R_{final}} = \frac{1}{R_{eq}} + \frac{1}{R_4}
  $$

Using advanced mathematical techniques such as **matrix representation of circuits** and **Laplace transformations**, we can generalize the problem for complex networks. The impedance matrix \( Z \) of the network can be derived using Kirchhoffâ€™s laws and then reduced using determinant-based transformations.

## Algorithmic Approach

To find the equivalent resistance between two nodes:

**Construct the Graph**: Parse circuit components into a graph data structure.

**Identify Series and Parallel Components**: Use graph traversal techniques such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

**Iteratively Reduce the Graph**:

   - Replace series connections with their equivalent resistance.

   - Merge parallel connections into a single equivalent resistor.

**Repeat Until Simplification is Complete**: Continue reducing until only two nodes remain (input and output terminals).

**Output the Equivalent Resistance**: The final edge weight represents the total equivalent resistance.

## Algorithm Implementation

### Pseudocode

```python
function compute_equivalent_resistance(graph, start, end):
    while graph has more than 2 nodes:
        for each node in graph:
            if node has exactly 2 neighbors (series connection):
            
                neighbor_1, neighbor_2 = get_neighbors(node)
                new_resistance = graph.get_edge_weight(node, neighbor_1) + graph.get_edge_weight(node, neighbor_2)
                merge_nodes(graph, node, neighbor_1, neighbor_2, new_resistance)
            
            elif node is part of a parallel connection:
        
                parallel_edges = get_parallel_edges(node)
                new_resistance = 1 / sum(1 / resistance for resistance in parallel_edges)
                merge_parallel_resistors(graph, node, new_resistance)

        if no changes were made:
           
            apply_advanced_reduction(graph) 
    
    return graph.get_edge_weight(start, end)

        
    RETURN the remaining resistance between start and end nodes
```

### Implementation Plan

Below is the initial representation of the circuit, modeled as a graph.  
Each **node (A, B, C, D)** represents a connection point in the circuit,

**Nodes (A, B, C, D):** Circuit junctions.

**Edges with weights:** Represent resistors with given resistance values.

**Graph Layout:** The spring layout is used for better visualization.

This graphical representation will help us simplify the circuit in the next steps, where we will iteratively reduce the network by identifying series and parallel resistors.



## Detecting and Merging Series and Parallel Resistors

To simplify the circuit, we apply the following rules:

**Series Resistors**: If a node has exactly two connections, the resistances are summed up and the node is removed.  
  - Formula: 

    \( 
    R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2
    \)

**Parallel Resistors**: If two nodes are connected by multiple resistors, they are merged using the parallel resistance formula.  

  - Formula:  

    $$
    \frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}
    $$

By applying these transformations iteratively, the circuit is reduced to a simpler form.

After detecting and merging series and parallel resistors, the simplified circuit looks like this:

In this step, the circuit graph has been progressively reduced by merging equivalent resistances until only two nodes remain, representing the total equivalent resistance of the system.



## Computing the Final Equivalent Resistance

After fully simplifying the circuit, only two nodes remain, representing the total equivalent resistance.
