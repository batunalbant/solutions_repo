## Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

### Motivation
Projectile motion, while seemingly simple, offers a rich playground for exploring fundamental principles of physics. The problem is straightforward: analyze how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection. Yet, beneath this simplicity lies a complex and versatile framework. The equations governing projectile motion involve both linear and quadratic relationships, making them accessible yet deeply insightful.

What makes this topic particularly compelling is the number of free parameters involved in these equations, such as initial velocity \( v_0 \), gravitational acceleration \( g \), and launch height \( h \). These parameters give rise to a diverse set of solutions that can describe a wide array of real-world phenomena, from the arc of a soccer ball to the trajectory of a rocket. Additionally, external factors such as air resistance, varying gravitational fields, and launch conditions create additional complexity that can be modeled mathematically.

The study of projectile motion also provides an excellent opportunity to apply numerical methods and computational simulations, enabling engineers and scientists to develop more efficient launch systems, design sports equipment, and predict celestial motions. Understanding these dynamics also fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills essential for scientific inquiry and technological innovation.

## Task

### 1. Theoretical Foundation
- Derive the governing equations of motion from Newton’s second law.
- Solve the basic differential equations to establish the general form of projectile motion.
- Highlight how variations in initial conditions produce diverse solutions.
- Discuss air resistance and gravitational variations as extensions to the basic model.

### Governing Equations
Projectile motion in two dimensions can be described by the following equations derived from Newton's laws:

\[ x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) t \]

\[ y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \]

where:
- \( v_0 \) = Initial velocity
- \( \theta \) = Launch angle
- \( g \) = Gravitational acceleration
- \( t \) = Time

The total flight time \( T \), maximum height \( H \), and horizontal range \( R \) are given by:

\[ T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g} \]

\[ H = \frac{v_0^2 \sin^2(\theta)}{2g} \]

\[ R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} \]

### 2. Analysis of the Range
- Examine how the horizontal range \( R \) varies with the angle of projection \( \theta \).
- Discuss the optimal angle for maximum range and explain the physics behind this phenomenon.
- Explore the influence of varying initial velocities and gravitational acceleration on the trajectory.

### 3. Practical Applications
- Discuss how projectile motion principles apply to various real-world contexts, including ballistics, sports such as golf or basketball, and aerospace applications.
- Address how the model can be extended to account for uneven terrain, air resistance, and wind effects, thereby increasing its accuracy and utility.

### 4. Implementation
- Develop and document a computational algorithm (Python) to simulate projectile trajectories under various initial conditions.
- Visualize the relationship between the projectile’s range and the angle of projection using graphical plots.
- Include animations or interactive elements to clearly illustrate how trajectories change with different parameters.

## Deliverables
- A Markdown document with embedded Python scripts or a Jupyter Notebook clearly demonstrating simulations.
- Detailed explanations of how variations in initial conditions produce a family of projectile trajectories.
- Visual plots depicting range versus launch angle, showing parameter sensitivity.

### 1. Theoretical Background
The general equations derived from Newton’s second law for projectile motion are:

\[ x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) t \]

\[ y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \]

### Python Simulation

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def projectile_range(v0, theta, g=9.81):
    theta_rad = np.radians(theta)
    return (v0**2 * np.sin(2*theta_rad)) / g

angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 100)
range_values = [projectile_range(10, theta) for theta in angles]

plt.plot(angles, range_values)
plt.xlabel("Launch Angle (degrees)")
plt.ylabel("Range (m)")
plt.title("Projectile Range vs. Launch Angle")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### Extended Analysis
