# Problem 1: Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

## Motivation

Projectile motion, while seemingly simple, provides a rich framework for exploring fundamental principles of physics. This problem requires analyzing how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection. The governing equations involve both linear and quadratic relationships, offering a blend of accessibility and depth.

Several free parameters, such as initial velocity, gravitational acceleration, and launch height, influence the trajectory. These variations allow us to explore real-world applications, from sports to rocket science.

## Theoretical Foundation

To analyze projectile motion, we start with Newton's equations of motion. The motion occurs in two independent components: horizontal and vertical.

### Governing Equations:

- **Horizontal Motion:**
  \(x = v_0 \cos(\theta) t\)
- **Vertical Motion:**
  \(y = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2\)
- **Time of Flight:**
  \(t_f = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}\)
- **Range:**
  \(R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}\)

### Derivation of Time of Flight

**The time of flight is determined by solving for the time when the projectile returns to the ground \(y = 0\):**

$$
0 = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
$$

**Factorizing:**

$$
 t \left( v_0 \sin(\theta) - \frac{1}{2} g t \right) = 0
$$

**Solving for \(t\):**

$$
 t = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad t = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
$$

**The non-trivial solution is taken as the total time of flight.**

### Derivation of Range

Using the time of flight in the horizontal displacement equation:

$$
 R = v_0 \cos(\theta) \times \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
$$

Using the trigonometric identity \(2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) = \sin(2\theta)\), we get:

$$
 R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
$$

## Implementation

To better visualize projectile motion, we implement a Python simulation that generates plots of the range as a function of angle. Additionally, we compute the full trajectory of the projectile to examine the path it follows.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def projectile_range(v0, g=9.81):
    angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 100)
    ranges = (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * np.radians(angles))) / g
    return angles, ranges

def projectile_trajectory(v0, theta, g=9.81, t_max=2):
    t = np.linspace(0, t_max, num=100)
    x = v0 * np.cos(np.radians(theta)) * t
    y = v0 * np.sin(np.radians(theta)) * t - 0.5 * g * t**2
    return x, y

# Example with v0 = 10 m/s
angles, ranges = projectile_range(10)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))

# Range Plot
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(angles, ranges)
plt.xlabel('Angle (degrees)')
plt.ylabel('Range (m)')
plt.title('Projectile Range vs. Angle')
plt.grid()

# Trajectory Plot for a Specific Angle
theta_example = 45
x, y = projectile_trajectory(10, theta_example)
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel('Horizontal Distance (m)')
plt.ylabel('Vertical Distance (m)')
plt.title(f'Projectile Trajectory for {theta_example} Degrees')
plt.grid()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This implementation allows for both range analysis across different launch angles and a visualization of the projectileâ€™s full motion for a chosen angle. The trajectory plot helps in understanding how the projectile moves through the air, while the range plot provides insights into how angle selection impacts overall displacement.
