<h1 id="equivalent-resistance-using-graph-theory">Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Understanding and analyzing electrical circuits is a fundamental aspect of electrical engineering and physics. One of the essential tasks in circuit analysis is determining the equivalent resistance between two points. Traditional methods rely on step-by-step application of series and parallel resistor combinations, which can become impractical for large and complex circuits. The need for a more systematic and scalable approach arises in applications such as circuit simulation, network analysis, and embedded system design.</p>
<p>Graph theory provides an alternative and efficient approach by representing the circuit as a weighted graph, where:</p>
<p><strong>Nodes</strong> correspond to junctions.</p>
<p><strong>Edges</strong> correspond to resistors with resistance values as weights.</p>
<p>By systematically simplifying this representation using graph algorithms, we can compute the equivalent resistance efficiently. This approach is particularly useful in modern circuit analysis tools, simulation software, and optimization techniques used in electronic circuit design. It also provides an automated way to handle complex networks, making the process faster and less prone to human errors.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Calculating equivalent resistance is a fundamental problem in electrical circuits, essential for understanding and designing efficient systems. Traditional methods involve iteratively applying series and parallel resistor rules, which become cumbersome for complex circuits. Graph theory provides a structured and algorithmic alternative, allowing us to model circuits as weighted graphs where:</p>
<p><strong>Nodes</strong> represent circuit junctions.</p>
<p><strong>Edges</strong> represent resistors, weighted by resistance values.</p>
<p>By employing graph reduction techniques, we can systematically simplify even intricate networks, leading to efficient circuit analysis methods used in modern applications like circuit simulation software, optimization problems, and network design. This method also integrates well with software-based solutions, allowing for real-time modifications and enhancements in circuit analysis.</p>
<h2 id="theoretical-background">Theoretical Background</h2>
<h3 id="graph-representation-of-electrical-circuits">Graph Representation of Electrical Circuits</h3>
<p>An electrical circuit can be represented as a graph:
<strong>Vertices (V):</strong> Represent junctions where resistors connect.</p>
<p><strong>Edges (E):</strong> Represent resistors, with edge weights corresponding to resistance values.</p>
<p><strong>Adjacency Matrix or List:</strong> Used to store the graph structure, where each row represents a node and each column represents a connection to another node with a specific resistance value.</p>
<h3 id="series-and-parallel-resistance-in-graphs">Series and Parallel Resistance in Graphs</h3>
<p><strong>Series Connection:</strong>
   - Resistors in series have the same current flowing through them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The total voltage across them is the sum of the individual voltages:</p>
<p>$$
 V_{eq} = V_1 + V_2 + ... + V_n
 $$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Ohm’s Law (<span class="arithmatex">\( V = IR \)</span>):</p>
<p>$$
 I R_{eq} = I R_1 + I R_2 + ... + I R_n
 $$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Canceling the common current <span class="arithmatex">\( I \)</span>:</p>
<p>$$
 R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n
 $$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Graphically, this corresponds to <strong>contracting</strong> a path of connected edges into a single edge, thus reducing the complexity of the graph.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parallel Connection:</strong>
   - Resistors in parallel share the same voltage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The total current is the sum of the individual currents:</p>
<p>$$
 I_{eq} = I_1 + I_2 + ... + I_n
 $$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Ohm’s Law:</p>
<p>$$
 \frac{V}{R_{eq}} = \frac{V}{R_1} + \frac{V}{R_2} + ... + \frac{V}{R_n}
 $$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Canceling the common voltage <span class="arithmatex">\( V \)</span>:</p>
<p>$$
 \frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ... + \frac{1}{R_n}
 $$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Graphically, this corresponds to <strong>merging</strong> multiple edges between two nodes into a single edge with a new weight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This merging reduces the computational complexity when analyzing circuits with multiple interconnected resistors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extended-formulas-for-complex-cases">Extended Formulas for Complex Cases</h3>
<p>For circuits involving mixed configurations of series and parallel resistances, the equivalent resistance must be determined iteratively. If a circuit consists of nested parallel and series resistances, the calculation follows a hierarchical approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identify the <strong>innermost</strong> parallel or series components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compute their equivalent resistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace these components with their equivalent resistance and repeat the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue until only one resistance remains.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if a circuit consists of three resistors <span class="arithmatex">\( R_1, R_2, R_3 \)</span> arranged in a mixed configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\( R_1 \)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\( R_2 \)</span> in parallel:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
  \frac{1}{R_{12}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}
  $$</p>
<ul>
<li>Then, <span class="arithmatex">\( R_{12} \)</span> is in series with <span class="arithmatex">\( R_3 \)</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
  R_{eq} = R_{12} + R_3
  $$</p>
<ul>
<li>If an additional resistor <span class="arithmatex">\( R_4 \)</span> is in parallel with <span class="arithmatex">\( R_{eq} \)</span>, we apply the parallel formula again:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
  \frac{1}{R_{final}} = \frac{1}{R_{eq}} + \frac{1}{R_4}
  $$</p>
<p>Using advanced mathematical techniques such as <strong>matrix representation of circuits</strong> and <strong>Laplace transformations</strong>, we can generalize the problem for complex networks. The impedance matrix <span class="arithmatex">\( Z \)</span> of the network can be derived using Kirchhoff’s laws and then reduced using determinant-based transformations.</p>

<h2 id="graph-reduction-technique">Graph Reduction Technique</h2>
<p>This technique involves reducing a complex circuit graph to a simpler graph by:</p>
<p><strong>Series Reduction:</strong> Replacing series resistors with their equivalent resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Parallel Reduction:</strong> Replacing parallel resistors with their equivalent resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Recursive Simplification:</strong> Continuously applying reduction rules until only the desired nodes remain.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="differential-analysis-of-graphs">Differential Analysis of Graphs</h2>
<p>In more complex circuits involving non-linear resistances or time-varying signals, the analysis requires differentiating network functions.</p>
<h3 id="ohms-law-and-differential-formulation">Ohm’s Law and Differential Formulation</h3>
<p>Using Ohm’s law, the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance can be written as:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ V = IR \]</div>
<p>If the resistance is a function of time or position, we can write:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ V(t) = I(t) R(t) \]</div>
<p>The rate of change of voltage with respect to time can be given by:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(IR) = I \frac{dR}{dt} + R \frac{dI}{dt} \]</div>
<p>This can be useful when analyzing circuits with inductive or capacitive components where resistance may vary with frequency.</p>
<h3 id="matrix-representation-of-circuits">Matrix Representation of Circuits</h3>
<p>For complex circuits, the impedance matrix <span class="arithmatex">\( Z \)</span> can be used to describe the system:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ V = ZI \]</div>
<p>Where <span class="arithmatex">\( Z \)</span> is an <span class="arithmatex">\( n \times n \)</span> matrix representing the impedances between nodes.</p>
<p>The individual elements of the matrix are calculated using the Laplacian matrix of the graph, where:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ Z_{ij} = \sum_{k} R_k \quad \text{if } i = j \]</div>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ Z_{ij} = -R_k \quad \text{if there is an edge between } i \text{ and } j \]</div>
<p>This matrix formulation allows us to solve complex networks using <strong>matrix inversion techniques</strong> or numerical methods.</p>

<h2 id="algorithm-description">Algorithm Description</h2>
<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>To calculate the equivalent resistance between two points in an electrical network represented as a graph.</p>

\sum_{k} R_k &amp; \text{if } i = j \text{ (Sum of resistances connected to node } i) \\
-R_k &amp; \text{if there is a resistor } R_k \text{ between nodes } i \text{ and } j \\
0 &amp; \text{if nodes } i \text{ and } j \text{ are not directly connected}
\end{cases}
